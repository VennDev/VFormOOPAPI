# VFormOOPAPI
- The Form design library for the server running PocketMine-PMMP5 is object-oriented.
- The library contains asynchronous tasks that help load form data to the player without having to wait too long, resulting in a server stop at a certain second!
- Integrate the feature of processing images on forms quickly!
- Also, using this library shows that your form design is clearly clear about which forms are the main and secondary forms! [Evidence](https://github.com/ClickedTran/GiftCode/blob/Master/src/ClickedTran/GiftCode/forms/FormManager.php)
- Please see [wiki](https://github.com/VennDev/VFormOOPAPI/wiki) to understand the features of the word form :D
